# NBodyIPFitting Development Notes

## List of variations to explore

* Laplace Regulariser
   * Integrate w.r.t. r or x
   * Apply Laplace w.r.t. r, x, or R?
* How to incorporate environment
   * next logical step: simple sums of pair potentials for the environment representation
   * then bond-angles?
* "Correct" weights for forces and virials
