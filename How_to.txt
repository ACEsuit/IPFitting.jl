# TO DO: Not automatized yet.

1 - run generate_invariants.sh with wanted Nbody and degree parameters.
This creates files in data_temp

2 - copy the files
a - NB_?_deg_?_irr_invariants.jl
b - NB_?_deg_?_prim_invariants.jl
c - NB_?_deg_?_non_efficient_invariants.jl
d - NB_?_deg_?_relations_invariants.jl
into the data folder

3 - do the following manipulations on these files :
In NB_?_deg_?_non_efficient_invariants.jl
a - change the definition of pv = zeros(?,1); by putting the right number.
b - write the primary invariants on a single line (cmd+j, cmd+shift+j)
c - check that no line starts with a + (otherwise wring computation of the invariants - check in particular pv[17] and pv[18]), and if there is, move the + to the previous line.
In NB_?_deg_?_prim_invariants.jl
a - keep only the leading monomials
b - check that the number of lines corresponds to the number of primary invariants

4 - run src_jl/generate_text_invariants.jl. This generates two files:
a - NB_?_deg_?_prim_text.jl which contains part of the text (the primary invariants) for the julia function of the invariants
b - NB_?_deg_?_irr_sec_text.jl which contains part of the text (the secondary invariants) for the generation of the invariants

5 - copy-paste the definition of the invariants into the corresponding file in test and use the relations between irreducible secondaries and secondaries to compute all of them.

6 - you can run test_invariants.jl to test them. For the moment, 4 primary invariants are not right.
